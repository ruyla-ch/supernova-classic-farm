# Idempotency and Error Contract V1

## 1. Purpose

This contract makes retries safe and gives H5 stable behavior for failures. It distinguishes:

- a request that definitely did not execute;
- a request whose outcome is unknown to GateSvr;
- a terminal business result;
- a connection that can no longer carry trusted commands.

## 2. Error shape

A failed RESPONSE contains one `Error`:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `code` | `ErrorCode` | Stable machine-readable enum |
| `params` | repeated key/value string | Values for client localization; never trusted as commands |
| `retryable` | `bool` | Whether automatic retry with the same request is allowed |
| `retry_after_ms` | optional `uint32` | Minimum delay when retryable |
| `latest_shop_entry` | optional `ShopEntryView` | Present for a changed quote |
| `current_plot` | optional `PlotView` | Present for a plot-state conflict when available |
| `debug_message` | optional `string` | Development/logging only; H5 MUST NOT show directly to users |

User-facing text is selected by H5 from `code + params`. The server MUST NOT rely on changing human-readable text as protocol semantics.

Newly executed errors that reach a Player Actor include the Actor's current `state_version`. A replayed terminal Actor error returns the original stored `state_version` as defined in section 9; it does not substitute the Actor's later current version. Envelope, authentication and routing errors that never reach an Actor omit it.

## 3. Stable error codes

### 3.1 Protocol and connection

| Value | Code | Client behavior |
|---:|---|---|
| 0 | `ERROR_UNSPECIFIED` | Treat as client defect; log |
| 100 | `INVALID_ARGUMENT` | Fix request; do not retry automatically |
| 101 | `UNKNOWN_ACTION` | Client/server contract mismatch; keep connection |
| 102 | `UNSUPPORTED_PROTOCOL_VERSION` | Upgrade/reload client; connection closes |
| 103 | `UNAUTHENTICATED` | Obtain a new WS ticket; connection closes |
| 104 | `FORBIDDEN` | Do not retry automatically |
| 105 | `REQUEST_ID_CONFLICT` | Generate a new ID only after correcting intent |
| 106 | `RATE_LIMITED` | Retry same request after `retry_after_ms` if it was not admitted |

Malformed Protobuf, oversized frames and envelope combinations that cannot be correlated may close the connection without a RESPONSE.

### 3.2 Transient service errors

| Value | Code | Client behavior |
|---:|---|---|
| 200 | `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` | Same-ID retry with backoff |
| 201 | `SERVER_BUSY` | Same-ID retry after `retry_after_ms` |
| 202 | `REQUEST_OUTCOME_UNKNOWN` | Same-ID retry; never generate a new ID |
| 203 | `CONFIG_UNAVAILABLE` | Same-ID retry with backoff |

`REQUEST_OUTCOME_UNKNOWN` means GateSvr cannot prove whether the Actor executed the command. It is the strongest reason to preserve the original `request_id`.

### 3.3 Shop and configuration

| Value | Code | Meaning |
|---:|---|---|
| 300 | `SHOP_ENTRY_NOT_FOUND` | Unknown entry |
| 301 | `SHOP_ENTRY_DISABLED` | Entry no longer available |
| 302 | `PRICE_CHANGED` | Quote version changed; response carries latest quote |
| 303 | `CONFIG_ENTRY_DISABLED` | Seed, crop, fertilizer or sell rule is no longer available |

After `PRICE_CHANGED`, H5 updates the quote, asks the player to confirm, then sends a new business intent with a new `request_id`.

### 3.4 Assets and inventory

| Value | Code | Meaning |
|---:|---|---|
| 400 | `INSUFFICIENT_COINS` | Balance cannot cover total price |
| 401 | `INVENTORY_TYPE_LIMIT` | Adding a new item type would exceed 100 types |
| 402 | `INVENTORY_STACK_LIMIT` | Result would exceed 300 of one item |
| 403 | `ITEM_NOT_OWNED` | Required seed or fertilizer is absent |
| 404 | `INSUFFICIENT_ITEM_QUANTITY` | Sell quantity exceeds inventory |
| 405 | `ITEM_NOT_SELLABLE` | Item has no active sell rule |

Harvest uses the same inventory limit codes and remains wholly unapplied on failure.

### 3.5 Farm

| Value | Code | Meaning |
|---:|---|---|
| 500 | `PLOT_NOT_FOUND` | Unknown plot |
| 501 | `PLOT_STATE_CONFLICT` | Action is illegal for current state |
| 502 | `FERTILIZER_ALREADY_ACTIVE` | Existing fertilizer has not expired |
| 503 | `CROP_NOT_MATURE` | Harvest requested before maturity |

When safe, `PLOT_STATE_CONFLICT` includes the current `PlotView`, allowing H5 to repair that plot without a full snapshot.

### 3.6 Tasks

| Value | Code | Meaning |
|---:|---|---|
| 600 | `CHAPTER_NOT_FOUND` | Unknown chapter |
| 601 | `CHAPTER_NOT_CLAIMABLE` | Tasks are incomplete or chapter is inactive |
| 602 | `CHAPTER_REWARD_ALREADY_CLAIMED` | A different request tries to claim an already claimed chapter |

A retry of the original successful claim request returns the original successful result, not `CHAPTER_REWARD_ALREADY_CLAIMED`.

### 3.7 Implemented friend extension

| Value | Code | Meaning |
|---:|---|---|
| 700 | `FRIEND_CODE_NOT_FOUND` | The code does not exist |
| 701 | `FRIEND_CODE_EXPIRED` | The code is no longer current or has expired |
| 702 | `CANNOT_FRIEND_SELF` | Caller attempted to redeem their own code |
| 703 | `FRIEND_LIMIT_REACHED` | Either player already has 100 active friends |
| 704 | `NOT_MUTUAL_FRIEND` | Visit or interaction authorization failed |
| 705 | `VISIT_NOT_FOUND` | The visit ID is unknown |
| 706 | `VISIT_EXPIRED` | The visit ID has expired |
| 720 | `PEST_ALREADY_ACTIVE` | Apply requested while a pest is active |
| 721 | `PEST_NOT_ACTIVE` | Catch requested without an active pest |
| 722 | `PEST_SOURCE_FORBIDDEN` | The applying Visitor tried to catch that pest |
| 723 | `STEAL_NOT_AVAILABLE` | The plot cannot currently be stolen from |

For the implemented MySQL friend slice, creating a code is repeat-safe but may
return the current unexpired code. Redeeming the same code after the
relationship is active returns success with `newly_created=false`.
`LIST_FRIENDS` is read-only. FriendSvr does not persist request-result records;
the unique current-code and unordered-pair keys provide the Slice-1
idempotency boundary. Owner-Actor pest mutations use the retained-result rules
below.

## 4. Which failures close the connection

Close after:

- invalid/expired authentication;
- unsupported protocol version;
- Session revoked by a newer login;
- oversized message;
- malformed envelope that prevents safe parsing;
- persistent invalid traffic or abuse.

Keep open after every normal business error, transient service error that can be answered safely, unknown action and invalid business argument.

## 5. Request ID rules

- H5 generates a canonical lowercase UUID before first send.
- Every REQUEST has an ID for correlation.
- Only write actions use the Player Actor idempotency window.
- A retry MUST preserve `request_id`, `action`, `target_player_id` and all semantic payload fields.
- A changed intent MUST use a new ID.
- GateSvr MUST preserve the ID across `NOT_OWNER` rerouting.
- Services MUST log the request ID, but MUST NOT use it as a secret or authentication token.

Idempotency scope is:

```text
(caller_player_id, request_id)
```

The stored fingerprint additionally covers action, target and semantic payload.

## 6. Canonical payload fingerprint

The Actor computes the fingerprint after Protobuf validation from:

```text
fingerprint_schema_version
+ protocol_version
+ action enum
+ target_player_id
+ action-specific known semantic fields in documented order
```

Examples:

```text
BUY_SEEDS:
shop_entry_id, quantity, expected_price_version

SELL_CROP:
crop_item_id, expected_price_version, amount branch, quantity when present

CATCH_PEST:
caller_player_id, target_player_id, plot_id

APPLY_PEST_TO_FRIEND:
action, visitor_player_id, owner_player_id, plot_id, pest_id

CATCH_PEST_FOR_FRIEND:
action, visitor_player_id, owner_player_id, plot_id
```

The fingerprint is not based on client-supplied hash text. Unknown compatible Protobuf fields do not change V1 semantics and are excluded by the V1 fingerprint schema.

## 7. Actor execution order

For a write request:

```text
validate envelope and authentication at Gate
→ route to target Actor
→ look up (caller_player_id, request_id)
→ existing + same fingerprint: return stored result with replayed=true
→ existing + different fingerprint: REQUEST_ID_CONFLICT
→ new request: pin server time and one config snapshot
→ validate business preconditions
→ execute or produce terminal business failure
→ store terminal result
→ respond
```

Successful execution:

```text
apply all business changes atomically
→ update task progress
→ player_seq++
→ store response, fingerprint and Outbox
→ checkpoint_revision++
→ mark Dirty
```

Terminal Actor business failure:

```text
do not change coins, inventory, plots, tasks or player_seq
→ store failure result in idempotency metadata
→ checkpoint_revision++
→ mark Actor Dirty
```

Caching terminal failures prevents a lost failure response from later becoming a success under the same ID after player state changes. The player may retry a corrected/new intent only with a new ID.

`checkpoint_revision` is the persistence CAS version defined by `data-model.md`. It is not part of client `state_version`. Any checkpoint-content mutation increments it even when `player_seq` remains unchanged.

Failures before Actor admission—malformed message, authentication failure, rate rejection, unavailable route—are not stored in the Player Actor.

For friend pest actions, the Visitor Zone validates the current visit and
mutual friendship before forwarding. Those pre-Owner failures are not retained
in the Owner Actor. Once admitted, the Owner Actor stores success and terminal
business failure under `(visitor_player_id, request_id)`, with
`target_player_id=owner_player_id`. The Owner checkpoint therefore keeps the
receipt beside the only business state that the command can mutate.

## 8. Stored result

Each retained write result stores:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `request_id` | Idempotency key component |
| `action` | Original action |
| `payload_fingerprint` | Canonical semantic fingerprint |
| `completed_at_ms` | Server completion time |
| `success` | Terminal outcome |
| `state_version` | Original result version |
| `response_payload` | Compact original typed receipt and patch |
| `error` | Original terminal business error when failed |
| `outbox_ids` | IDs created by this command, if any |

Retention is at most the newest 100 write results per player and at most 24 hours. Entries older than 24 hours are removed; if more than 100 remain, oldest entries are removed.

The retained response MUST stay below the protocol message limit. Full Player Snapshots are query responses and are never stored in the idempotency window.

## 9. Replay behavior

Same ID and same fingerprint:

- returns the first terminal success or failure;
- sets envelope `replayed = true`;
- returns the original `state_version`, receipt, patch and error;
- does not execute validation, deduct assets, advance tasks, create Outbox or increment `player_seq` again.

For a cross-Zone friend pest action, replay returns the first stored
`PublicPlotView` or error with `replayed=true`. It does not mutate the Owner
again and emits no duplicate `PLAYER_STATE_CHANGED` or
`FRIEND_FARM_CHANGED`. Deterministic failures such as
`PEST_ALREADY_ACTIVE`, `PEST_NOT_ACTIVE`, and `PEST_SOURCE_FORBIDDEN` are
retained after Owner-Actor admission and replay unchanged even if the plot
later changes.

The client displays the receipt but applies its state patch only under normal version rules:

- original seq is older/equal to local: ignore patch;
- exactly local + 1: apply;
- gap: request full snapshot;
- different epoch: replace with full snapshot.

If an ID has expired from the retention window, the server cannot recognize it. Clients MUST NOT automatically retry write intents older than 24 hours; they must refresh state and ask the player to initiate a new intent.

## 10. Retry policy

### Automatic same-ID retry

Allowed only for:

- connection loss before a correlated response;
- client timeout;
- `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE`;
- `SERVER_BUSY`;
- `REQUEST_OUTCOME_UNKNOWN`;
- `CONFIG_UNAVAILABLE`;
- `RATE_LIMITED` when the response states the request was not admitted.

Use bounded exponential backoff with jitter. Stop when the HTTP Session expires or the intent is older than 24 hours.

### Refresh and create a new ID

Required for:

- `PRICE_CHANGED` after player confirms latest price;
- a corrected invalid quantity;
- a new action after `PLOT_STATE_CONFLICT`;
- any changed payload;
- retry after the idempotency retention window.

### Never automatic

Do not automatically repeat:

- insufficient coins or items;
- inventory limits;
- active fertilizer;
- immature crop;
- task not claimable;
- forbidden action.

## 11. Dirty recovery consequence

The idempotency window is part of the same Dirty checkpoint as player state and Outbox.

Dirty persistence orders checkpoint contents by `checkpoint_revision`; WebSocket state ordering remains `(owner_epoch, player_seq)`.

After abnormal Zone loss, both the latest business mutation and its idempotency result may roll back together to the last MySQL checkpoint. A new `owner_epoch` forces the client to accept a full snapshot.

V3 does not claim durable exactly-once execution across an unflushed abnormal failure. It provides:

- exactly-once behavior within the active Actor and retained checkpoint;
- atomic recovery of player state, retained result and pending Outbox;
- an explicit bounded-loss window accepted by ADR-0006.

## 12. Required tests

1. same ID and payload executes each write once;
2. same ID with a changed field returns `REQUEST_ID_CONFLICT`;
3. successful replay returns the original version and receipt;
4. failed business result is replayed even after Actor state later changes;
5. query request IDs are correlated but not retained;
6. `NOT_OWNER` reroute preserves ID and does not duplicate execution;
7. price refresh requires a new ID after player confirmation;
8. claim reward replay creates no duplicate inventory or mail Outbox;
9. retention enforces both 100-result and 24-hour bounds;
10. epoch recovery restores player state, idempotency records and Outbox from one checkpoint.
